🐶 Dog Breed Classification
A deep learning project that classifies images of dogs into their respective breeds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to build a model that can accurately recognize the breed of a dog from a given image.

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify dog breeds from images using a CNN-based model. It uses a preprocessed dataset of labeled dog images and applies transfer learning with fine-tuning for accurate results.

🔍 Problem Statement
Given an image of a dog, predict the correct breed from a list of known breeds. This has applications in:

Pet identification systems

Veterinary services

Animal shelters

Dog lover communities

🧠 Model Architecture
Transfer Learning Model: e.g., ResNet50 / EfficientNetB0 / VGG16

Layers Added:

Global Average Pooling

Dense (ReLU)

Dropout

Output layer (Softmax)

🗂️ Dataset
Source: Dogs Dataset

Classes: ~120 dog breeds

Format: JPEG images with breed-specific folders

Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)

🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

OpenCV (optional, for image handling)
